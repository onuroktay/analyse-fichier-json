The Nutcracker: The Classic Christmas Fantasy features two rare versions of the holiday tale that was adapted for Tchaikovskys classic ballet, The Nutcracker. E.T.A. Hoffmanns original fairy tale, The Nutcracker and the Mouse King, published in 1816 and Alexandre Dumass interpretation, The History of a Nutcracker, published in 1845. Lavishly illustrated with hundreds of vintage drawings from the nineteenth century, this beautifully designed book kindles the spirit of the holidays through its timeless tale of an enchanted nutcracker made human through the love of a young girl, and the couples magical journey through exotic lands of sweets and spices. The set also contains a decorative 8-inch nutcracker figurine! After hearing how her toy nutcracker got his ugly face, a little girl helps break the spell and watches him change into a handsome prince., "
